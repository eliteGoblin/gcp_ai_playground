## Phase 1: Opening the Call

### Outbound Collection Call

**Script**:
> "Hello, this is [Your Name] calling from [Company]. May I speak with [Customer Name]?"

*If customer confirms identity:*
> "Thank you. For security purposes, could you please confirm your date of birth?"

*Once verified:*
> "Thank you. I'm calling regarding your account with us. Is now a convenient time to discuss this?"

### Inbound Call

**Script**:
> "Thank you for calling [Company]. My name is [Your Name]. How may I help you today?"

*After customer explains:*
> "I'd be happy to help with that. First, for security purposes, may I have your name and date of birth?"

### Key Opening Principles

- Be warm but professional
- Don't rush the opening
- Always verify identity before discussing account
- Confirm it's a convenient time to talk

## Phase 2: Discovery

### Active Listening Techniques

1. **Let them speak**: Don't interrupt
2. **Acknowledge**: "I understand", "I see"
3. **Clarify**: "Let me make sure I understand..."
4. **Summarize**: "So what you're saying is..."

### Discovery Questions

**For payment issues**:
- "Can you tell me about your current situation?"
- "What's making it difficult to pay right now?"
- "Are there any changes in your circumstances I should know about?"

**For disputes**:
- "Can you tell me what you believe is incorrect?"
- "Do you have any documentation that supports this?"
- "When did you first notice this issue?"

**For hardship**:
- "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's happening?"
- "How long do you expect this situation to continue?"
- "What payment amount would be manageable for you right now?"

### Recognizing Emotional States

| Customer Shows | Your Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| Anger | Stay calm, acknowledge frustration, don't defend |
| Anxiety | Reassure, explain process clearly, offer support |
| Confusion | Slow down, simplify, check understanding |
| Sadness | Show empathy, give them time, offer help |

## Phase 3: Solution

### Presenting Options

**Always offer multiple options**:
> "Based on what you've told me, I have a few options that might work for you. Would you like to hear them?"

**Structure each option clearly**:
1. What the option is
2. How it works
3. What's required from them
4. Timeline

**Example**:
> "Option one is a payment plan where you'd pay $50 per week for the next 12 months. This would clear the balance and stop any additional fees. Would that work with your budget?"

### Handling Objections

**"I can't afford that"**
> "I understand. What amount would be manageable for you? Let's see if we can find something that works."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course, take the time you need. Shall I note this on your account and call you back in a few days?"

**"This isn't fair"**
> "I hear your frustration. Let me explain the situation and see what options we have to address your concerns."

### Reaching Agreement

**Confirm understanding**:
> "Just to confirm, you've agreed to pay $50 per week starting this Friday. Is that correct?"

**Document everything**:
- Amount agreed
- Start date
- Payment method
- Next review date

## Phase 4: Closing

### Professional Close

**Script**:
> "Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, [Customer Name]. To summarize, we've agreed to [summary of agreement]. Your first payment of [amount] is due on [date]. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

*If no:*
> "Thank you for your time. Have a great day."
