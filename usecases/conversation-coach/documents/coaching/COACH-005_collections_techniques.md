# Collections Best Practices

## Purpose

This guide provides ethical and effective techniques for collections conversations. The goal is to help customers resolve their accounts while maintaining compliance and building positive relationships.

## Core Principles

### 1. Customer-Centric Approach
- Every customer has a story - understand before solving
- Focus on helping, not demanding
- Build rapport before discussing solutions

### 2. Compliance First
- Never use prohibited language
- Always provide required disclosures
- Recognize and respond to hardship

### 3. Solution-Oriented
- Offer multiple options
- Be flexible within guidelines
- Find what works for the customer

---

## Effective Techniques

### 1. Building Rapport First

**Don't jump straight to the debt**. Spend 30-60 seconds connecting:

> "Hello [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. Before we get into the details, how are you doing today?"

**Why it works**: People are more cooperative when they feel respected.

### 2. Using Open-Ended Questions

**Instead of**: "Can you pay today?"
**Ask**: "What payment options would work for you?"

**Instead of**: "Why haven't you paid?"
**Ask**: "Can you tell me what's been going on with the account?"

**Why it works**: Open questions give you information and make customers feel heard.

### 3. The "Help" Frame

**Frame yourself as a helper, not a collector:**

> "I'm calling to see how I can help you resolve this account."
> "My goal is to find something that works for your situation."
> "I want to help you get this sorted out."

**Why it works**: Shifts from adversarial to collaborative dynamic.

### 4. Silence as a Tool

**After presenting options, be silent.** Let the customer think.

- Count to 5 before speaking
- Resist the urge to fill silence
- Let them process and respond

**Why it works**: Silence creates space for decision-making without pressure.

### 5. Assumptive Language

**Use confident, positive language:**

> "When you make the payment..." (not "If you decide to pay...")
> "Would Tuesday or Friday work better for you?" (not "Can you pay?")
> "Let me set that up for you..." (assumes agreement)

**Why it works**: Guides conversation toward positive outcome.

## Negotiation Techniques

### 1. Start High, Be Flexible

**Initial offer**: Full balance or maximum reasonable payment
**Prepared to accept**: Minimum acceptable arrangement

**Example**:
> "The best option would be to clear the full $500 today. Would that work?"
> [If no] "I understand. What if we split it into two payments?"
> [If still no] "What amount could you manage right now?"

### 2. The "What Would Work" Question

When customer says they can't pay:
> "I hear you. What amount would work for you, even if it's small?"

**Why it works**: Gets them to name a number instead of refusing.

### 3. Payment Date Commitment

**Always get a specific date and amount:**

> "So we're agreeing to $50 by Friday the 15th. Is that correct?"

**Why it works**: Specific commitments are more likely to be kept.

### 4. Minimum Payment Floor

**Know your authority**:
- What's the minimum you can accept?
- When do you need to escalate?
- What flexibility do you have?

**If below your floor**:
> "I appreciate you being open with me. Let me check with my team to see if we can accommodate that amount."

## Handling Common Objections

### "I Can't Afford Anything"

**Response**:
> "I understand things are tight. Even a small amount keeps the account in good standing. What's the smallest amount you could manage, even $10?"

**Follow-up**:
> "If there's truly nothing available, we have hardship options. Can you tell me more about your situation?"

### "I'll Pay When I Get Paid"

**Response**:
> "When do you get paid? Let's schedule the payment for that day."

**Get commitment**:
> "So $X on [specific date]. I'll note that on the account. Is that a firm commitment?"

### "I Don't Have the Money Right Now"

**Response**:
> "I understand. When do you expect to have something available?"

**Explore options**:
> "Would it help to break this into smaller, more manageable payments?"

### "I Need to Talk to My Partner"

**Response**:
> "That makes sense. When can you discuss it and call us back?"

**Set callback**:
> "Can I call you back on [day] to see what you've decided?"

### "I Forgot" (Missed Payment)

**Response**:
> "These things happen. Can we set up an automatic payment so you don't have to remember?"

## Payment Arrangement Best Practices

### Setting Up Arrangements

1. **Be specific**: Amount, date, frequency
2. **Confirm understanding**: Read it back
3. **Set expectations**: What happens if missed
4. **Document everything**: Notes on account

### Arrangement Script

> "Let me confirm what we've agreed:
> - You'll pay $50 every Friday
> - Starting this Friday, [date]
> - For the next 10 weeks
> - This will clear the balance
> Is that correct?"

### Following Up

- Review date if arrangement is long
- Call before payment is due (reminder)
- Call after missed payment (same day if possible)

- Customer mentions suicide/self-harm
- Customer claims identity theft
- Customer says debt is in dispute
- Signs of vulnerability

## Efficiency Techniques

- Know the options you can offer
- Have notes from previous calls

### 2. Get to the Point (Politely)
- Don't ramble
- State purpose early
- Keep call focused

### 3. Summarize Frequently
> "Just to make sure we're on the same page..."

### 4. Close Efficiently
> "Is there anything else I can help with today? Great, thanks for your time."
