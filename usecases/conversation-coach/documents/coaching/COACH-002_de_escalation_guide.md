# De-escalation Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides techniques for calming upset customers and turning difficult conversations into positive outcomes. Effective de-escalation protects both the customer and the agent.

## The LEARN Framework

Use this 5-step process for any escalated situation:

```
L - LISTEN     Let them speak without interrupting
E - EMPATHIZE  Show you understand their feelings
A - APOLOGIZE  Apologize for their experience (not admitting fault)
R - RESOLVE    Focus on finding a solution
N - NOTIFY     Confirm next steps and follow up
```

## Step 1: Listen

### Why It Matters
- Angry customers need to feel heard
- Interrupting escalates frustration
- You gather information to help them

### Techniques
- Stay silent while they speak
- Use minimal encouragers: "I see", "Mm-hmm"
- Take notes on key points
- Let them finish completely

### What NOT to Do
- Interrupt with solutions
- Say "calm down"
- Defend the company immediately
- Sigh or show frustration

**Duration**: Let them speak for at least 30-60 seconds without interruption.

## Step 2: Empathize

### Core Empathy Statements

**Acknowledge their feelings**:
> "I can hear how frustrated you are."
> "I understand this situation is upsetting."
> "That sounds really stressful."

**Validate their experience**:
> "I would feel the same way in your situation."
> "You have every right to be upset about this."
> "That's a completely understandable reaction."

**Show you're on their side**:
> "I want to help you sort this out."
> "Let's work together to find a solution."
> "I'm going to do my best to help you today."

### What NOT to Say
- "I understand, but..." (negates the empathy)
- "There's nothing I can do"
- "That's not my fault"
- "You should have..."

## Step 3: Apologize

### Types of Apologies

**For their experience (safe, always appropriate)**:
> "I'm sorry you've had this experience."
> "I apologize for the frustration this has caused."
> "I'm sorry you're dealing with this situation."

**For specific issues (when appropriate)**:
> "I apologize for the miscommunication."
> "I'm sorry for any confusion we've caused."

### What Apology Is NOT
- Admitting fault or liability
- Making promises you can't keep
- Taking personal responsibility for company actions

## Step 4: Resolve

### Transition to Solution

**Bridge statement**:
> "Now that I understand the situation, let me see what I can do to help."

### Solution-Focused Questions
- "What outcome would you like to see?"
- "What would make this right for you?"
- "How can I help resolve this today?"

### Offering Options
> "I have a few options that might help. Would you like to hear them?"

**Always give them choice** - this restores sense of control.

### If You Can't Resolve

**Be honest**:
> "I want to be upfront with you. This is beyond what I can approve myself. Let me escalate this to someone who can help."

## Step 5: Notify

### Confirm Understanding
> "Just to confirm, we've agreed that [summary]. Is that correct?"

### Set Expectations
> "Here's what happens next: [steps]. You should hear from us by [timeframe]."

### Follow Up
- Document everything
- Set reminders for follow-up
- Send written confirmation if applicable

## Common De-escalation Scenarios

### "This is ridiculous!"

**Response**:
> "I can hear your frustration. This situation sounds really difficult. Tell me what happened so I can help."

### "I want to speak to a manager!"

**Response** (first request):
> "I understand. Before I transfer you, let me see if I can resolve this for you directly. Can you tell me more about what happened?"

**Response** (second+ request):
> "I understand you'd like to speak with a supervisor. Let me transfer you now."

### "You people are useless!"

**Response**:
> "I'm sorry we've disappointed you. I want to do everything I can to help you today. What's the main issue you're facing?"

### "I'm going to report you!"

**Response**:
> "I understand you're very upset. You absolutely have the right to make a complaint, and I can give you that information. But first, can I try to resolve this for you?"

## Body Language for Phone

Even on the phone, your "body language" matters:

### Do
- Sit up straight (affects voice tone)
- Smile slightly (affects voice warmth)
- Take deep breaths (stays calm)
- Speak slowly and clearly

### Avoid
- Sighing audibly
- Typing loudly while they speak
- Rushing your words
- Sounding impatient

## When to Escalate

### Immediate Escalation Required
- Threats of violence
- Mentions of self-harm
- Supervisor requested 3+ times
- You feel unsafe or overwhelmed

### Consider Escalation
- You've tried de-escalation twice without success
- Customer demands something you can't approve
- Complex situation beyond your authority

## Self-Care After Difficult Calls

- Take a brief break if needed
- Deep breathing exercises
- Talk to team lead if upset
- Don't take it personally

## Scoring Impact

### Excellent De-escalation (+2 to +3)
- Customer calmer at end than start
- Resolution achieved
- Empathy demonstrated throughout

### Partial De-escalation (0 to +1)
- Some calming effect
- Customer still frustrated but manageable

### Failed De-escalation (-2 to -4)
- Customer more upset at end
- Escalated the situation
- No empathy shown
