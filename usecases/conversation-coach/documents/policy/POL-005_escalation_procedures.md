# Escalation Procedures

## Purpose

This document defines when and how agents must escalate calls to supervisors or specialized teams. Proper escalation protects both customers and the company.

## Immediate Escalation Triggers (CRITICAL)

### 1. Self-Harm or Suicide Mentions

**Trigger phrases**:
- "I want to kill myself"
- "I'm going to end it"
- "I don't want to live anymore"
- "What's the point of living"
- "I might as well be dead"
- Any reference to suicide or self-harm

**Required action**:
1. Stay calm and express concern
2. Say: "I'm concerned about what you've just said. Your wellbeing is important."
3. Provide Lifeline number: 13 11 14
4. Warm transfer to supervisor immediately
5. Do NOT end the call abruptly

**Script**:
> "I hear that you're going through an incredibly difficult time. I want you to know that help is available. Lifeline is available 24/7 at 13 11 14. I'm going to connect you with someone who can provide more support. Please stay on the line."

### 2. Violence Threats

**Trigger phrases**:
- "I'm going to hurt someone"
- "I'll come down there"
- "You'll regret this"
- Any threat of physical harm

**Required action**:
1. Remain calm, don't escalate
2. Do not engage with the threat
3. Document exact words
4. Warm transfer to supervisor
5. Report to security if specific threat

**Script**:
> "I understand you're frustrated. Let me connect you with my supervisor who may be better able to help with your situation."

### 3. Identity Theft Claims

**Trigger phrases**:
- "I didn't open this account"
- "Someone stole my identity"
- "This isn't my debt"
- "I've been a victim of fraud"

**Required action**:
1. Stop collection activity immediately
2. Document the claim
3. Transfer to fraud/disputes team
4. Provide case number

**Script**:
> "I take identity theft very seriously. Let me transfer you to our specialized team who handles these situations. They'll investigate this thoroughly."

### 4. Repeated Supervisor Requests

**Trigger**: Customer requests supervisor 3+ times

**Required action**:
1. After third request, escalate immediately
2. Do not argue or delay further
3. Warm transfer with summary

**Script** (at third request):
> "I understand you'd like to speak with a supervisor. Let me connect you now. Please hold while I transfer you."

## Standard Escalation Triggers

### 5. Complex Hardship Situations

**When to escalate**:
- Multiple debts involved
- Bankruptcy mentioned
- Legal action in progress
- Complex family situations

### 6. Complaint Escalation

**When to escalate**:
- Customer explicitly wants to complain
- Threatens to go to AFCA
- Mentions legal action
- Previous complaint unresolved

### 7. Technical/Account Issues

**When to escalate**:
- System shows incorrect information
- Account discrepancies
- Multiple failed transactions
- Disputed charges

## Escalation Levels

| Level | Who | When |
|-------|-----|------|
| Level 1 | Team Lead | Standard issues, supervisor requests |
| Level 2 | Manager | Complaints, complex hardship |
| Level 3 | Specialist Team | Fraud, legal, AFCA referrals |
| Level 4 | Emergency | Self-harm, violence, immediate safety |

## Warm vs Cold Transfer

### Warm Transfer (Preferred)
1. Brief the receiving party on the situation
2. Introduce the customer
3. Stay on line until connection confirmed

### Cold Transfer (Only When Necessary)
1. Explain to customer who they're being transferred to
2. Provide direct number in case of disconnection
3. Document the transfer

## Documentation Requirements

For all escalations, document:
1. Time and date
2. Trigger for escalation
3. Exact customer quotes (if safety-related)
4. Action taken
5. Who received the escalation
6. Outcome

## De-escalation Before Escalation

For non-critical situations, attempt de-escalation first:
1. Listen without interrupting
2. Acknowledge their frustration
3. Offer solution options
4. If unsuccessful after 2 attempts, escalate

## Compliance Scoring Impact

| Situation | Correct Response | Score Impact |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Self-harm mentioned, Lifeline provided | Excellent | +2 to +3 |
| Violence threat, supervisor transfer | Appropriate | Neutral |
| 3+ supervisor requests ignored | Violation | -3 to -5 |
| Fraud claim not escalated | Violation | -2 to -4 |

## Emergency Contacts

| Situation | Contact |
|-----------|---------|
| Suicide/Self-harm | Lifeline: 13 11 14 |
| Domestic Violence | 1800 RESPECT: 1800 737 732 |
| Police Emergency | 000 |
