# Corporate Compliance Overview

## Purpose

This document outlines our company's compliance framework for contact center operations, aligned with Australian regulatory requirements including ASIC RG 96 and the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).

## Regulatory Framework

### Primary Regulations

| Regulation | Scope | Authority |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| ASIC RG 96 | Debt collection practices | ASIC/ACCC |
| Australian Consumer Law | Consumer protection | ACCC |
| National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 | Credit activities | ASIC |
| Privacy Act 1988 | Personal information handling | OAIC |

### Key Compliance Principles

1. **Fair Treatment**: Treat all customers with dignity and respect
2. **Transparency**: Provide clear, accurate information about debts and options
3. **No Harassment**: Never use pressure tactics, threats, or coercion
4. **Privacy Protection**: Safeguard customer information
5. **Hardship Assistance**: Proactively offer assistance to customers in difficulty

## Compliance Dimensions

### 1. Communication Standards

- Use professional, respectful language at all times
- Clearly identify yourself and the company
- State the purpose of the call
- Allow customers time to respond and seek advice

### 2. Contact Limits

Per ASIC RG 96:
- **Maximum frequency**: 3 contacts per week, 10 per month
- **Permitted hours**: 7:30am - 9:00pm local time
- **Prohibited days**: Public holidays

### 3. Required Disclosures

Agents must inform customers of:
- Their right to dispute the debt
- Available hardship programs (when financial difficulty mentioned)
- Payment plan options
- How to lodge a complaint

### 4. Prohibited Conduct

Agents must never:
- Threaten legal action (unless actually in legal proceedings)
- Threaten wage garnishment (without court order)
- Contact employers about debts
- Disclose debt information to third parties
- Use harassment, coercion, or intimidation

### 5. Hardship Recognition

When customers indicate financial hardship, agents must:
- Acknowledge their situation with empathy
- Immediately offer hardship program information
- Document the conversation appropriately
- Avoid pressure for immediate payment

## Compliance Monitoring

### Coaching Scores

All conversations are analyzed and scored on compliance (1-10):
- **9-10**: Perfect compliance, all disclosures made
- **7-8**: Good compliance, minor omissions
- **5-6**: Adequate, some missing disclosures
- **3-4**: Poor, missing key requirements
- **1-2**: Critical violations requiring immediate review

### Escalation Requirements

Immediate escalation to supervisor required if customer:
- Mentions suicide or self-harm
- Threatens violence
- Claims identity theft
- Requests supervisor 3+ times
