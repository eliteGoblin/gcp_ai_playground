# Prohibited Language Guidelines

## Purpose

This document defines language and phrases that agents must NEVER use during customer interactions. Using prohibited language is a compliance violation that may result in regulatory penalties.

## Critical Violations (Immediate Escalation Required)

### Threats of Legal Action

**NEVER say** (unless debt is actually in legal proceedings):
- "We will take you to court"
- "You'll be sued"
- "Our lawyers will be in contact"
- "This will go to legal action"
- "You'll have a judgment against you"

**Why prohibited**: Threatening legal action when not actually pursuing it is misleading and may constitute harassment under ASIC RG 96.

**Penalty risk**: Up to $1.7M for corporations under ASIC Act.

### Threats of Wage Garnishment

**NEVER say** (unless court order exists):
- "We'll garnish your wages"
- "This will come out of your paycheck"
- "We'll take it from your employer"
- "Your wages will be docked"

**Why prohibited**: Wage garnishment requires a court order. Threatening it without legal basis is deceptive conduct.

### Employer Contact Threats

**NEVER say**:
- "We'll call your employer"
- "Your boss will find out"
- "We'll contact your work"
- "This will affect your job"

**Why prohibited**: Contacting employers about personal debts is a privacy violation and potential harassment.

### Third Party Disclosure

**NEVER say to anyone other than the account holder**:
- Details about the debt amount
- Account information
- Payment history
- Reason for the call (beyond "personal business matter")

**Why prohibited**: Privacy Act 1988 prohibits disclosure of personal financial information.

## High-Risk Language (Avoid)

### Pressure Tactics

**Avoid phrases like**:
- "You must pay today"
- "This is your last chance"
- "If you don't pay right now..."
- "I've heard every excuse"
- "That's not my problem"

**Better alternatives**:
- "Let's discuss what options work for you"
- "I'd like to help find a solution"
- "What payment arrangement would be manageable?"

### Dismissive Language

**Avoid phrases like**:
- "That's your responsibility"
- "Everyone has problems"
- "You should have thought of that"
- "I don't care about your situation"

**Better alternatives**:
- "I understand this is difficult"
- "Let me see how I can help"
- "We have options for situations like yours"

### Blaming Language

**Avoid phrases like**:
- "You got yourself into this"
- "You should have paid earlier"
- "This is your fault"
- "You're the one who..."

**Better alternatives**:
- "Let's focus on finding a solution"
- "What matters now is moving forward"
- "How can we work together on this?"

## Harassment Indicators

The following patterns may constitute harassment:
- Repeated calls after customer requests to stop
- Excessive pressure during a single call
- Refusing to accept customer's stated limitations
- Making customer feel trapped or intimidated
- Continuing to discuss debt after customer's clear refusal

## Compliance Issue Types

When violations are identified, they are classified as:

| Issue Type | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| THREAT_LEGAL_ACTION | Threatening court/lawyers without legal proceedings | CRITICAL |
| THREAT_GARNISHMENT | Threatening wage garnishment without court order | CRITICAL |
| HARASSMENT | Pressure tactics, repeated pressure, intimidation | CRITICAL |
| PRIVACY_VIOLATION | Disclosing debt to third parties | CRITICAL |
| DISMISSIVE_LANGUAGE | Dismissing customer concerns or situation | HIGH |
| BLAME_SHIFTING | Blaming customer for their situation | MEDIUM |

## Coaching Guidance

If prohibited language is used:
1. Identify the exact quote and turn number
2. Explain why it's prohibited
3. Provide specific alternative phrasing
4. Score compliance appropriately (typically 1-4 for critical violations)
