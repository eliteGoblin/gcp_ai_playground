# Hardship Provisions

## Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for identifying and assisting customers experiencing financial hardship. Proper handling of hardship situations is both a regulatory requirement and a core company value.

When a customer mentions ANY of the following, agents MUST offer hardship assistance:

#### Employment-Related
- "I lost my job"
- "I've been laid off"
- "I'm unemployed"
- "My hours were cut"
- "The company closed down"
- "I was made redundant"

#### Health-Related
- "I'm sick"
- "I've been in hospital"
- "I have medical bills"
- "I'm dealing with illness"
- "I had surgery"
- "I'm disabled"

#### Family-Related
- "I'm going through a divorce"
- "My partner left"
- "There was a death in the family"
- "I'm a single parent now"
- "I'm caring for someone"

#### Financial Indicators

- "I'm a disaster victim"

## Required Response to Hardship

### Step 1: Acknowledge

**Say something like**:
> "I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. That sounds really difficult."

**Do NOT**:
- Dismiss their situation
- Rush past their explanation
- Immediately ask for payment

### Step 2: Offer Hardship Program

**Required disclosure**:
> "We have a hardship program specifically designed to help customers in situations like yours. Would you like me to explain what options are available?"

### Step 3: Explore Options

Present available options:
1. **Reduced payments**: Lower regular payments for a period
2. **Payment pause**: Temporary suspension of payments
3. **Extended terms**: Spread payments over longer period
4. **Waived fees**: Remove late fees or charges
5. **Interest freeze**: Stop interest accumulation temporarily

### Step 4: Document

Record in the system:
- Hardship type (employment, medical, family, etc.)
- Options discussed
- Customer's preferred arrangement
- Review date

## Hardship Program Options

| Option | Description | Typical Duration |
