## Transcript

```
AGENT: Hello, this is Mike from ABC Collections. May I speak with—

CUSTOMER: Finally! Do you know how long I've been waiting? This is ridiculous!

AGENT: I apologize for the wait. I can hear you're frustrated, and I want to help. Can I get your name so I can look at your account?

CUSTOMER: It's David Brown. And yes, I'm frustrated! I just got a statement with $150 in fees. This is outrageous!

AGENT: Thank you, David. I'm pulling up your account now. I understand the fees are frustrating – let me see what's going on and what we can do about it.

CUSTOMER: You better do something. I've been a customer for years and this is how you treat people?

AGENT: I hear you, David, and your history with us matters. I can see the fees were applied when some payments didn't go through. I know that doesn't make them easier to deal with, but let me see what options I have.

CUSTOMER: The payments didn't go through because your system is broken! I scheduled them!

AGENT: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you thought everything was set up. I apologize for that experience. Let me look into this for you.

CUSTOMER: So what are you going to do about it?

AGENT: David, given your payment history with us and the confusion around the scheduled payments, I'm going to waive these fees for you as a goodwill gesture. They'll be removed from your account.

CUSTOMER: Oh... really? All of them?

AGENT: Yes, all $150. I want to make this right. And let me also help you set up a more reliable payment method so this doesn't happen again. Would that help?

CUSTOMER: Yes, that would be great. Thank you. I'm sorry I was so harsh earlier.

AGENT: No need to apologize – I would have been frustrated too. Let's get you set up properly.
```

## Why This Is Excellent

### De-escalation Strengths
1. **Didn't match energy**: Stayed calm when customer was angry
2. **Acknowledged frustration immediately**: "I can hear you're frustrated"
3. **Apologized for experience**: Not defensive about the fees
4. **Took ownership**: "I'm going to waive these fees"

### Key De-escalation Moments

**Turn 2** (Initial response to anger):
> "I apologize for the wait. I can hear you're frustrated, and I want to help."

Instead of defending the wait time, agent:
- Apologized
- Acknowledged emotion
- Offered help

**Turn 6** (Response to blame):
> "That sounds really frustrating, especially when you thought everything was set up. I apologize for that experience."

Instead of arguing about whose fault it was, agent:
- Validated the frustration
- Apologized for the experience
- Moved toward solution

### Resolution Strengths
1. **Concrete action**: Fees waived
2. **Prevents recurrence**: Offered to set up better payment method
3. **Customer satisfaction**: Customer apologized for being harsh

### The Turnaround

| Call Stage | Customer Emotion | Agent Action |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Opening | Angry, shouting | Stayed calm, acknowledged |
| Middle | Accusatory | Apologized, didn't defend |
| Resolution | Surprised, grateful | Confirmed action, offered more help |
| Close | Apologetic | Reassured, moved forward |

## What to Learn

### Do This
- Stay calm regardless of customer's tone
- Acknowledge frustration without defending
- Look for ways to make it right
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Accept apology graciously

### The LEARN Framework Applied

| Step | What Agent Did |
|------|----------------|

| **R**esolve | Waived fees, offered better setup |
