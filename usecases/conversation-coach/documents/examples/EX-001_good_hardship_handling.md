## Transcript

```
AGENT: Hello, this is Sarah from ABC Collections. May I speak with John Smith?

CUSTOMER: Yes, that's me.

AGENT: Thank you, John. For security purposes, could you please confirm your date of birth?

CUSTOMER: March 15, 1985.

AGENT: Thank you. I'm calling about your account with us. Is now a convenient time to talk?

CUSTOMER: I... I guess. Look, I know I'm behind. I lost my job three months ago and everything has been falling apart.

AGENT: I'm really sorry to hear that, John. Losing your job is incredibly stressful, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be managing bills on top of that. Thank you for being upfront with me about your situation.

CUSTOMER: I want to pay, I really do. I just don't have the money right now. I've been applying for jobs everywhere.

AGENT: I hear you, and I want you to know that we have options specifically for situations like yours. We have a hardship program that can help take some of the pressure off while you're looking for work. Would you like me to explain what that looks like?

CUSTOMER: Yes, please. I didn't know there were options.

AGENT: Absolutely. Given your situation, we could either pause your payments for 3 months, giving you time to focus on finding work, or we could reduce your payments to a small amount that keeps the account in good standing. What would work better for you?

CUSTOMER: A pause would be amazing. I just need some breathing room.

AGENT: I completely understand. Let me set that up for you. Your payments will be paused for 3 months, and we'll touch base in 90 days to see how things are going. If you find work sooner, just give us a call and we can adjust.

CUSTOMER: Thank you so much. This is such a relief.

AGENT: I'm glad I could help, John. Is there anything else you need from me today?

CUSTOMER: No, this is great. Thank you for being so understanding.

AGENT: You're welcome. I hope things turn around for you soon. Good luck with the job search, and please don't hesitate to call if your situation changes.

2. **Validation**: "Losing your job is incredibly stressful"
3. **Understanding tone**: "I can only imagine how difficult..."
4. **Gratitude for honesty**: "Thank you for being upfront with me"

### Compliance Strengths
1. **Proper identity verification**: Date of birth confirmed
2. **Hardship program offered immediately**: When job loss mentioned

### Key Moments

**Turn 4** (Agent response to hardship):
> "I'm really sorry to hear that, John. Losing your job is incredibly stressful, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be managing bills on top of that."

This response demonstrates:
- Immediate empathy (not jumping to solutions)
- Specific acknowledgment (job loss)
- Validation of feelings
- No pressure or blame

**Turn 6** (Hardship offer):
> "We have a hardship program that can help take some of the pressure off while you're looking for work."

This demonstrates:
- Proactive offer (not waiting to be asked)
- Positive framing ("help take pressure off")
- Recognition of customer's goals (looking for work)
