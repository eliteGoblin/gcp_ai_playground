    { "turn_index": 0, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Good morning, Example Finance hardship team, this is Sarah speaking. How can I help you today?", "ts_offset_sec": 0 },
    { "turn_index": 1, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Finally! I've been trying to get through for forty-five minutes! This is absolutely ridiculous. Your company has been harassing me with calls and letters and I've had ENOUGH!", "ts_offset_sec": 8 },
    { "turn_index": 2, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I'm really sorry to hear that. Waiting that long must have been incredibly frustrating, especially when you're already dealing with a stressful situation. I can hear how upset you are, and I want you to know I'm here to help resolve this today. Can I start by getting your name?", "ts_offset_sec": 20 },
    { "turn_index": 3, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "It's David. David Park. Account number is 7744829.", "ts_offset_sec": 38 },
    { "turn_index": 4, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Thank you, David. I can see your account here. Before we go any further, I just want to acknowledge that I can see there have been multiple contact attempts, and I understand how overwhelming that can feel. Let me take a proper look at your situation. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on?", "ts_offset_sec": 45 },
    { "turn_index": 5, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "What's been going on? I'll tell you what's been going on. My wife was diagnosed with cancer three months ago. I had to take unpaid leave to care for her. We've been drowning in medical bills. And your company keeps calling and threatening me like I'm some kind of criminal! Do you people have no humanity?", "ts_offset_sec": 62 },
    { "turn_index": 6, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "David, I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you and your wife are going through right now. That is an incredibly difficult situation, and the last thing you need is added stress from us. I want you to know that supporting our customers through hard times is exactly what the hardship team is here for. Let me see what options we have to make this easier for you.", "ts_offset_sec": 88 },
    { "turn_index": 7, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Options? The last person I spoke to said I had to pay $2,000 immediately or you'd start legal action. Two thousand dollars! We don't have that. Everything is going to treatment and keeping a roof over our heads.", "ts_offset_sec": 112 },
    { "turn_index": 8, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I'm looking at the notes from that call now, David, and I have to say - that doesn't align with our hardship policy at all. I apologise that you were given that information. Let me be clear: when someone is facing genuine financial hardship like you are, we have much more flexibility than that. Can you tell me roughly what your current income and essential expenses look like?", "ts_offset_sec": 128 },
    { "turn_index": 9, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "My wife was the main earner. She's on sick leave now, getting about 60% of her salary through income protection. I've had to go back to work part-time. Between us, maybe $4,500 a month. But after rent, utilities, food, her medication... there's almost nothing left. Maybe $150 to $200.", "ts_offset_sec": 155 },
    { "turn_index": 10, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Thank you for sharing that with me, David. I know it's not easy to talk about finances when you're already under so much pressure. Based on what you've told me, I'm going to recommend we put your account on a hardship hold. This means we'll pause all collection activity - no more calls, no letters, no late fees accruing - for 90 days.", "ts_offset_sec": 185 },
    { "turn_index": 11, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Wait, really? You can do that? The other person made it sound like I had no options at all.", "ts_offset_sec": 210 },
    { "turn_index": 12, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Absolutely, David. This is exactly what hardship provisions are designed for. And after the 90 days, we'll reassess. If your wife's treatment is ongoing, we can extend it. When you are ready to resume payments, we can set something up that actually fits your budget - even if that's $50 a month.", "ts_offset_sec": 218 },
    { "turn_index": 13, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "I... I don't know what to say. This is completely different from what I expected. I was ready for a fight.", "ts_offset_sec": 240 },
    { "turn_index": 14, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I understand. And honestly, David, you shouldn't have to fight when you're going through something like this. I also want to mention - we have a partnership with a financial counselling service. They're completely free and independent from us. They can help you look at all your debts and expenses holistically. Would you like me to text you their details?", "ts_offset_sec": 252 },
    { "turn_index": 15, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "That would actually be really helpful. We've been so focused on the medical stuff, we haven't had time to step back and look at the bigger picture.", "ts_offset_sec": 278 },
    { "turn_index": 16, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Of course. I'll send that through after our call. Now, I'm also noting that you mentioned the previous agent gave you incorrect information about legal action. I'm going to escalate that internally because that's not how we should be treating anyone, especially someone in your situation. You shouldn't have had that added worry.", "ts_offset_sec": 290 },
    { "turn_index": 17, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Thank you. I was so angry after that call. I actually recorded it because I thought I might need to make a complaint.", "ts_offset_sec": 315 },
    { "turn_index": 18, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "You were absolutely right to be concerned. I'm glad you're speaking with me today so we can get things on the right track. Let me also check - is there anything else on your account that's been worrying you? Any other charges or fees that don't look right?", "ts_offset_sec": 325 },
    { "turn_index": 19, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Actually yes - there's a $75 late fee from last month. And the month before. That's $150 that we really can't afford.", "ts_offset_sec": 345 },
    { "turn_index": 20, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Let me look at those. Given your circumstances and the fact that you've been trying to work with us in good faith, I'm going to waive both of those fees right now. I've just processed that - you should see a credit of $150 on your next statement.", "ts_offset_sec": 355 },
    { "turn_index": 21, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Sarah, seriously, thank you. You have no idea how much this means. When I called, I honestly thought about just hanging up and ignoring everything. This is such a relief.", "ts_offset_sec": 375 },
    { "turn_index": 22, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I'm so glad we could help, David. That's exactly why I'm in this role. Let me summarise what we've done today: I've placed your account on a 90-day hardship hold with no fees or collection activity, I've waived $150 in late fees, I'll send you the financial counselling details, and I've noted to follow up with you after 90 days to see how you're going.", "ts_offset_sec": 390 },
    { "turn_index": 23, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "That's amazing. And please, if there's a way to give you a good review or something, let me know. You've completely turned my day around.", "ts_offset_sec": 420 },
    { "turn_index": 24, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "That's very kind of you, David. There should be an email survey after this call if you'd like to share your feedback. But honestly, knowing I've been able to help you focus on what really matters - your wife's recovery - that's the best part of my job.", "ts_offset_sec": 432 },
    { "turn_index": 25, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "I'll definitely fill that out. And Sarah - thank you. Really. Please pass on to your supervisor that you've been exceptional. I hope my wife's care team is half as compassionate as you've been today.", "ts_offset_sec": 452 },
    { "turn_index": 26, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "That means a lot, David. Please give my best wishes to your wife. I truly hope her treatment goes well. Take care of yourself too - caregiver burnout is real. Is there anything else I can help with today?", "ts_offset_sec": 470 },
    { "turn_index": 27, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "No, you've done more than I could have hoped. Thank you again.", "ts_offset_sec": 490 },
    { "turn_index": 28, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "You're very welcome, David. I'll send that text with the counselling details now. Take care, and we'll be in touch in 90 days. All the best to you and your family.", "ts_offset_sec": 496 }
