    { "turn_index": 4, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Thanks Daniel. For privacy, I just need to confirm a couple of details. Can you confirm your date of birth?", "ts_offset_sec": 22 },
    { "turn_index": 5, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Ugh... 14th of May 1992. Can you hurry this up please?", "ts_offset_sec": 31 },
    { "turn_index": 6, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Thank you. And can you just confirm the street number of your address on file?", "ts_offset_sec": 38 },

    { "turn_index": 8, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Appreciate your patience. I'm calling about an overdue balance of $420.30 on your account. I'd like to discuss some options to help you resolve it.", "ts_offset_sec": 54 },
    { "turn_index": 9, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "You people keep calling me! It's harassment at this point. I'm absolutely sick of it.", "ts_offset_sec": 66 },
    { "turn_index": 10, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I'm really sorry it's felt that way, Daniel. That's not our intention. My goal here is to sort this out with you so we can stop the calls. Are you able to chat for just two minutes now, or should we schedule a better time?", "ts_offset_sec": 75 },
    { "turn_index": 11, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Not right now, no. And don't call me at work ever again. Someone called my work line yesterday and I nearly got in trouble with my manager.", "ts_offset_sec": 89 },
    { "turn_index": 12, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I completely understand and I apologise for that. I can update your contact preference right now so we don't call your work number again. What's the best number to reach you on?", "ts_offset_sec": 101 },
    { "turn_index": 13, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "My mobile. It's 0412 778 903. And only call after 6pm. Weekdays only.", "ts_offset_sec": 112 },
    { "turn_index": 14, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Thank you. I'm noting down: mobile ending 8903, call only after 6pm on weekdays, and no calls to your work number. Would you also like us to send you confirmations by email?", "ts_offset_sec": 126 },
    { "turn_index": 15, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Yes. Email me. I want everything in writing from now on.", "ts_offset_sec": 138 },

    { "turn_index": 18, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Got it, I've recorded that. Now, just to keep you informed, the balance is $420.30. Are you in a position to make any payment today, or would a payment plan work better for you?", "ts_offset_sec": 166 },
    { "turn_index": 19, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "No, I'm not paying anything today. Money is really tight right now. You guys just don't listen.", "ts_offset_sec": 182 },
    { "turn_index": 20, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I hear you, Daniel. If paying today isn't possible, we can definitely look at setting up a plan. What sort of amount would be manageable for you on a weekly basis, roughly?", "ts_offset_sec": 193 },
    { "turn_index": 21, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Maybe $30 a week. Maybe. But I'm telling you now, if you call my work again, I will make a formal complaint.", "ts_offset_sec": 208 },
    { "turn_index": 22, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Understood. I've recorded your contact preferences and we will follow them. If $30 a week works for you, we can set that up starting next Friday. Does Friday suit for the payments?", "ts_offset_sec": 223 },
    { "turn_index": 23, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Friday's fine. After 6pm. And text me the details too if you can.", "ts_offset_sec": 238 },
    { "turn_index": 24, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Okay. I'll email you the payment plan details today and I've noted your preference for after-6pm contact. I can't guarantee SMS in all cases, but I'll record your request.", "ts_offset_sec": 248 },
    { "turn_index": 25, "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Fine. Just... stop annoying me.", "ts_offset_sec": 264 },
    { "turn_index": 26, "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Completely understood, Daniel. I'll send that email today and we'll follow up after 6pm on Friday. Thanks for your time.", "ts_offset_sec": 272 }
