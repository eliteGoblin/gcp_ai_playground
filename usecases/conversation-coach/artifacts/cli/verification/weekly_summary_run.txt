Summary:
  Agent M7741's performance this week was critically deficient, with an overall 
average score of 1.1 out of 10 across 7 calls. All core metrics, including 
Empathy, Compliance, and Resolution, consistently scored 1.0, indicating a 
complete failure to meet basic expectations. Key issues identified include 
threatening legal action, failing to offer hardship options, and using 
dismissive language, as evidenced in the calls needing review. While basic call 
opening protocols were sometimes followed, these were overshadowed by severe 
deficiencies in customer interaction and policy adherence.

Trend Analysis:
  Performance remained consistently low across the two days with calls, showing 
no improvement in any dimension. The 0% resolution rate and uniform 1.0 scores 
across all critical metrics highlight a pervasive and unaddressed performance 
gap throughout the week.

Action Plan:
  1. Immediately review and adhere to all compliance guidelines, specifically 
regarding legal action threats and mandatory hardship offer procedures. 2. Focus
on active listening and empathetic communication, ensuring customer situations 
are acknowledged and addressed without dismissive language or blame-shifting. 3.
Thoroughly review the Hardship Program Guide to correctly identify and offer 
appropriate solutions to customers in financial difficulty.

Recommended Training:
  - Compliance Basics
  - Empathy Building
  - Hardship Program Guide

Top Issues:
  - THREAT_LEGAL_ACTION
  - MISSING_HARDSHIP_OFFER
  - NO_ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Strengths:
  + The agent correctly identified the customer at the beginning of the call.
  + The agent clearly stated the purpose of the call and the outstanding debt 
amount.
  + The agent correctly identified themselves and the company at the beginning 
of the call (Turn 1, Turn 3).
